# Breast Cancer Detection Streamlit Application

This project is a Streamlit application designed to assist in the detection of breast cancer. Utilizing a variety of machine learning models and data preprocessing techniques, the application offers users insights into breast cancer diagnosis through data visualization and model evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare your dataset for analysis with automated data cleaning features including handling missing values, duplicate removal, and outlier capping.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize the dataset with correlation matrices, pair plots, and cluster analyses to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train machine learning models like SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes directly within the app. Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, along with confusion matrices.
- **Interactive UI:** Easily upload datasets, select models, and choose visualization techniques through a user-friendly interface.
