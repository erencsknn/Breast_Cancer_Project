| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id | Unique identifier for each observation. |
| diagnosis | Diagnosis result of the tumor. It can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). |
| radius_mean | Mean radius of tumor cells. |
| texture_mean | Mean texture of tumor cells. It represents the smoothness or roughness of the surface. |
| perimeter_mean | Mean perimeter of the tumor. |
| area_mean | Mean area of the tumor. |
| smoothness_mean | Mean smoothness of the tumor surface. Smoothness is a measure of surface roughness. |
| compactness_mean | Mean compactness of tumor cells. Compactness is related to the ratio of perimeter to area. |
| concavity_mean | Mean concavity level of tumor cells. It indicates the frequency and depth of concavities and recesses. |
| concave points_mean | Mean number of concave points on the tumor surface. |
| symmetry_mean | Mean symmetry of the tumor. |
| fractal_dimension_mean | Mean fractal dimension of the tumor, representing the degree of irregularity in the edge and overall appearance of cells. |
| radius_se | Standard error of the radius. |
| texture_se | Standard error of the texture. |
| perimeter_se | Standard error of the perimeter. |
| area_se | Standard error of the area. |
| smoothness_se | Standard error of smoothness. |
| compactness_se | Standard error of compactness. |
| concavity_se | Standard error of concavity. |
| concave points_se | Standard error of the number of concave points. |
| symmetry_se | Standard error of symmetry. |
| fractal_dimension_se | Standard error of fractal dimension. |
| radius_worst | Worst (largest) radius of tumor cells. |
| texture_worst | Worst (most rough or irregular) texture of tumor cells. |
| perimeter_worst | Worst (largest) perimeter of the tumor. |
| area_worst | Worst (largest) area of the tumor. |
| smoothness_worst | Worst (lowest) smoothness of the tumor surface. |
| compactness_worst | Worst (highest) compactness of tumor cells. |
| concavity_worst | Worst (highest) concavity level of tumor cells. |
| concave points_worst | Number of worst (highest) concave points on the tumor surface. |
| symmetry_worst | Worst (lowest) symmetry of the tumor. |
| fractal_dimension_worst | Worst (highest) fractal dimension of the tumor. |

### High Correlations

- There are high correlations (greater than 0.9) between features like "radius_mean," "area_mean," and "perimeter_mean" because "area_mean" and "perimeter_mean" are calculated using "radius_mean" values.
- There exists a very high correlation (0.98) between "texture_mean" and "texture_worst" ("texture_worst" being the maximum value of all textures).
- Moderate to high correlations (0.7 to 0.9) are observed among "compactness_mean," "concavity_mean," and "concave points_mean."
- There is a tendency for correlation (0.7) between "symmetry_mean" and "symmetry_worst."
- "Fractal_dimension_mean" and "fractal_dimension_worst" tend to correlate (0.77).

## Distribution and Outliers:

- There is a certain level of differentiation in the values of radius, perimeter, and area between benign (diagnosis = 0) and malignant (diagnosis = 1) data points.
- Outliers are visible in the box plot of each feature, indicating the necessity of addressing them during data preprocessing.
- The distribution appears to be a right-skewed Gaussian-like distribution.
- Texture_se values lie within the same range for both malignant and benign data points.
- Clear distinctions between benign and malignant data points are observed in the values of texture_mean and texture_worst.
